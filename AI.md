# AI Assistance Documentation

This document details how AI tools were used to assist in the development of this project.

## Tools Used

- **ChatGPT-4**: Used for code generation, debugging, and documentation assistance
- **GitHub Copilot**: Used for code completion and suggestions

## Specific Uses

### 1. Sequence Diagram Analysis
- **Tool**: ChatGPT-4
- **Purpose**: To understand synchronous vs. asynchronous calls in sequence diagrams
- **Result**: Clear explanation received and implemented in documentation

### 2. Code Generation
- **Tool**: ChatGPT-4
- **Purpose**: Generate example sequence diagram code with both synchronous and asynchronous calls
- **Result**: PlantUML code created demonstrating both call types

### 3. Documentation
- **Tool**: ChatGPT-4
- **Purpose**: Assist in creating comprehensive README and AI documentation
- **Result**: Well-structured documentation files

## Benefits Gained

1. Faster understanding of complex concepts
2. Rapid prototyping of diagram examples
3. Improved documentation quality
4. Code consistency through intelligent suggestions

## Ethical Considerations

All AI-generated code was reviewed, tested, and modified as needed to ensure correctness and alignment with project requirements. AI was used as an assistance tool rather than a replacement for developer judgment.
